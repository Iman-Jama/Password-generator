# Password-generator

In this weeks challenge, I was given starter code and asked to complete the code to create a random password generator. Below I will explain how the website works.

## **How the password generator website works**

When you access the webpage, you will be presented with an empty box and a red button which says "generate password". Once you click this button, you will be presented with a series of prompts, which give you the option to choose the following:
1. How long you want your password to be. You must choose a number between 8 - 128 and will be presented with an alert if you do not choose a number within these values.
2. If you want numbers in your password.
3. If you want loweercase characters in your password.
4. If you want Uppercase characters in your password.
5. If you want special characters in your password. 

Once you have finished going through the prompts and have made your selections, you will be presented with your password.
